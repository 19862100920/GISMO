%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% README FILE FOR THE XCORRLOCATE TOOLBOX %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Welcome weary seismologists! (or...more likely...mitch in the future)

    This is the instructions on how to use the xcorrlocate application within
    the GISMO seismic analysis toolbox. The purpose of this application is to 
    provide a set of functions for working with similar waveforms/repeated 
    earthquakes/multiplets. Currently, this application is built to take output
    from the Java program 'Peakmatch', which creates groupings of similar
    waveforms based on a given correlation threshold, and convert it to a 
    format that GISMO can work with. Below is a list of functions and their
    descriptions. 

Classes:

    Multiplet          -    The Multiplet class is a blueprint/container 
                            for the relevant data such as channelinfo, files,
                            waveforms, and arrivalinfo. 
                            methods:
                                Multiplet() - constructor 
                                stack()     - make a stack from the waveform
                                              object
                                pick()      - make a pick on the stack and 
                                              apply it to all the waveforms

Functions:

    load_waveforms()   -    Takes a list from the peakmatch output, finds 
                            the files within your data structure, and loads
                            them into a single waveform object.
                            SCAFOLD: currently this function assumes a certain
                            data structure. will update in release.

    station_replace()  -    reads a waveform object and replaces the channel
                            tag with whatever the user specifies. This function
                            is used to find the same events on different
                            stations.

    clip_waveforms()   -    replicates the windowing done in peakmatch for
                            the correlations. Peakmatch finds the highest 
                            peak in the waveform and grabs 4 seconds before
                            it and 8 seconds after. This function does that
                            on the waveforms within the waveform object. 

    correlate_waveforms() - correlates the waveforms in a waveform object 
                            above the given threshold. 

    station_subsets()  -    performs the correlations on all the stations 
                            given and returns a Multiplet object with the list of
                            events that correlates above the threshold on
                            every station. 

    network_compare()  -    takes a Multiplet object from station_subsets() 
                            and finds the events that appear on all of the
                            stations and returns a Multiplet object with those 
                            events on each station. CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION

    network_subset()   -    performs correlation on each station to find the
                            subset that appears on all stations. Returns a 
                            Multiplet object.
