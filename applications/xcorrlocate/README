%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% README FILE FOR THE XCORRLOCATE TOOLBOX %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Welcome weary seismologists!

    This is the instructions on how to use the xcorrlocate toolbox within
    the GISMO seismic analysis toolbox. The purpose of this toolbox is to 
    provide a set of functions for working with similar waveforms/repeated 
    earthquakes/multiplets. Currently, this toolbox is built to take output
    from the Java program 'Peakmatch', which creates groupings of similar
    waveforms based on a given correlation threshold, and convert it to a 
    format that GISMO can work with. Below is a list of functions and their
    descriptions. 

Functions: (put in the order that you would typically use in the workflow)

    load_waveforms()   -    Takes a list from the peakmatch output, finds 
                            the files within your data structure, and loads
                            them into a single waveform object.
                            SCAFOLD: currently this function assumes a certain
                            data structure. will update in release.

    station_replace()  -    reads a waveform object and replaces the channel
                            tag with whatever the user specifies. This function
                            is used to find the same events on different
                            stations.

    clip_waveforms()   -    replicates the windowing done in peakmatch for
                            the correlations. Peakmatch finds the highest 
                            peak in the waveform and grabs 4 seconds before
                            it and 8 seconds after. This function does that
                            on the waveforms within the waveform object. 

    correlate_waveforms() - correlates the waveforms in a waveform object 
                            above the given threshold. 

    station_subsets()  -    performs the correlations on all the stations 
                            given and returns a struct with the list of
                            events that correlates above the threshold on
                            every station. 

    network_compare()  -    takes the output struct from station_subsets() 
                            and finds the events that appear on all of the
                            stations and returns a struct with those events
                            on each station.
