 DESCRIBE(THREECOMP) provides detailed descriptions of threecomp object
 properties and how they are related.


 ------------------- COORDINATE SYSTEM -------------------------
 The threecomp object is designed to use a familiar spherical polar
 coordinate system in which horizontal direction on Earth is given in
 clockwise degrees from north: north is 0; east is 90; south is 180; and
 west is 270 degrees. Vertical directions are given with respect to
 vertical up. up is 0 degrees; horizontal is 90 degrees; and 180 is down.


 ------------------ TRACE NAME CONVENTIONS -----------------------
 Trace names follow the convention of network-station-channel-location.
 (Internally, this is enforced via the scnlobject and waveform objects.)
 Station and channel codes have particular importance in threecomp
 objects. A simple check is performed upon initiation to ensure that all
 three traces in each object come from the same seismic station. In other
 words, all three traces must have the same station code. The channel
 codes have specific meaning and users are encouraged to make sure that
 channel names are correct before converting to a threecomp object. The
 threecomp channel code convention adheres to the SEED standard of a
 minimum three character name where the third character represents the
 component orientation. Threecomp requires that the third channel
 characters be: Z-N-E, Z-R-T, or Z-2-1. Modest deviations from these
 channel names are accomodated by the horizontal and vertical orientation
 properties (see below). However, the actual channel names must contain
 one of these character sets. 


 ------------------ COMPONENT ORIENTATIONS ----------------------
 The orientation of each component of trace data is essential to
 performing any type of three component analysis. The safest way to ensure
 that component orientations are correct is to provide them explicitly.
 The THREECOMP function allows users to provide the horizontal and
 vertical orientation of all three channels of data. It is also possible
 to read these parameters automatically from the original waveforms if they
 have been set as properties there. If no orientation information is
 given, THREECOMP will assign default values where possible.

 DEFAULT VALUES
 If the component (third character of the channel name) is Z, N, E and no
 explicit orientation is given, then the orientations are assumed to be 
       Z: [0 0]    N:[0 90]    E: [90 90]
 This is equivalent to calling the THREECOMP function with an orientation
 matrix [0 0 0 90 90 90 ; ... ; ... ]. If the components are Z, R, T, and
 a backazimuth is given, then the horizontal components will be aligned
 accordingly. Components of Z, 2, 1 do not have any default orientations.
 Orientations provided as arguments to function THREECOMP, and
 orientations described in the input waveform properties, will override
 default values. For details see horizontal and vertical orientation
 descriptions below.

 HORIZONTAL ORIENTATION
 This attribute specifies the orientation of the component in the
 horizontal plane, measured clockwise from North.  For a North-South
 orientation, positive toward the north, the horizontal orientation is 0.
 For East-West orientation with positive to the east, the horizontal
 orientation is 90. Allowable range is 0 to 360.

 VERTICAL ORIENTATION
 This attribute measures the angle between the sensitive axis of a
 seismometer and the outward-pointing vertical direction.  For a
 vertically-oriented seismometer, the vertical orientation is 0, or 180
 (to reverse the sense of the instrument). For a horizontally oriented
 component, the vertical orientation is 90. Allowable range is 0 - 180.

 RADIAL TRANSVERSE COORDINATE SYSTEM
 Threecomp objects recognize the familiar coordinate system of vertical,
 radial, and transverse (ZRT). In this system the positive radial
 direction (R+) is 180 degrees opposite the backazimuth. The relative
 component orientations in a ZRT coordinate system are the same as in ZNE
 coordinates. That is, the positive transverse direction points 90 degrees
 clockwise from the positive radial direction. For example, for a wave
 arriving from due south on Z-N-E components, there is no rotation and N
 becomes R, while E becomes T.


 ------------------ PARTICLE MOTION ----------------------
 Particle motions are calculated in a sliding time window. In each window
 the covariance matrix of the three waveform vectors in computed. The
 eigenvectors of the covariance matrix define the dominant orientations of
 the data, while the eigenvalues express the relative amplitudes in each
 of these directions. Conceptually, rectilinearity expresseses the
 relative dominance of the largest eigenvalue (range is 0 to 1). Planarity
 is the degree to which the largest two eigenvalues dominate (range is 0
 to 1). Azimuth and inclination give the spherical polar orientation of
 the largest eigenvector. It is important to note that azimuth and
 inclination only have meaning if the waveforms show a high degree of
 rectilinearity or in some orientations, planarity. It makes sense - think
 about it!

 Energy is computed from the trace of the eigenvalue matrix. The
 calculation is performed independent of the data type. The term &quot;energy&quot;
 should be treated carefully however. This term is essentially just the
 square of the total particle velocity. The &quot;energy&quot; units are the square
 of whatever units the input waveforms had. IF the input traces are in
 velocity, then the energy term is the seismic kenetic energy density,
 (smoothed over size of the sliding time window). If the input traces are
 not velocity, then the output cannot be used as a proxy for physical
 energy.</pre></div>
