GISMO helps a lot of researchers prepare their papers for conferences and publication. There are around 300 subscribers to the GISMO Users listserv and GISMO is downloaded over 1000 times a year. But GISMO is supported by unpaid volunteers only. So please help us out by citing this work in your paper. Suggested citation:
