This repository was migrated from Google Code (code.google.com/p/gismotools) to GitHub on August 1st, 2015: prompted by shutdown of the Google Code service.

<h3>Description</h3>
The GISMO suite is an object-oriented Matlab toolbox for seismic data analysis. The GISMO toolbox consists of: (1) an object-oriented set of low-level classes which describe seismic waveform data and seismic event catalogs ; (2) a set of higher level classes (e.g. the correlation class) which build on the core classes ; and (3) an ever-evolving set of contributed codes developed from these core products. Users are strongly encouraged to join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gismotools/">GISMOTOOLS user group</a> for advice and updates.
